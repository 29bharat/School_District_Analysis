# School_District_Analysis
Module 4
District Summary:
From the below comparison, we conclude that the average score for both math and Reading hasn’t been affected – reason being rows with NaN values are not taken into consideration while calculating Mean. However, % Passing Math and % Passing Reading as well as % Overall Passing has dropped for Charter School Type after data correction because Thomas High School is a Charter School. No change in the District School Type.
